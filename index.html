            <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
            <p>An unassuming young man was travelling, in midsummer, from his native city of Hamburg to Davos - Platz in the Canton of the Grisons, on a three weeks’ visit. From Hamburg to Davos is a long journey — too long, indeed,for so brief a stay. It crosses all sorts of country; goes up hill and down dale, descends from the plateau of Southern Germany to the shore of Lake Constance, over its bounding waves and on across marshes once thought to be bottomless.</p>
